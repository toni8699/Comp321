Sample test cases
=================
- `sample01`: `[3,1,10,2,6]` with full-range queries to show hits in early, mid, last, and unreachable positions.
- `sample02`: `[5]` double-checks single-pile boundaries (first vs. last coin).
- `sample03`: `[2,8,4]` hits each pile boundary exactly to confirm prefix handling.
- `sample04`: `[4,2,5]` proves interior hits and an out-of-range query produce mixed answers.
- `sample05`: `[1,1,1,1]` keeps piles uniform so graders can sanity-check straight counting.

Secret test cases (handpicked)
==============================
- `secret01`: `[10]`, queries `[1,10,11]` for the minimal full case plus impossible.
- `secret02`: `[1_000_000]*5` stresses large counts and an extra query at 5,000,001.
- `secret03`: `[1]*1000` scales $N$ and probes first/middle/last/impossible slots.
- `secret04`: `[10,1,10,1]` alternates pile sizes to flush out off-by-one errors.
- `secret05`: `[500]` with queries `1..501` checks dense output and line formatting.
- `secret06`: 25k piles of 1 with queries for 25,001 coins triggers TLE in naive $O(NQ)$.
