Sample test cases
=================
- `sample01`: `[3,1,10,2,6]`; queries hit early coins, mid-pile, the last coin, and an impossible request.
- `sample02`: `[5]`; checks the first and last coin in a single pile.
- `sample03`: `[2,8,4]`; each query lands at a different pile boundary.
- `sample04`: `[4,2,5]`; includes an interior hit and an impossible value.
- `sample05`: `[1,1,1,1]`; walks across four uniform piles.

Secret test cases (handpicked)
==============================
- `secret01`: `[10]`, queries `[1,10,11]` to show valid vs impossible in one pile.
- `secret02`: five piles of one million; probes the first coin, the 1e6 boundary, the final coin, and an impossible extra.
- `secret03`: `[1]*1000`; tests first, middle, last, and one past the total.
- `secret04`: `[10,1,10,1]`; alternating large/small piles with dense requests.
- `secret05`: single pile `[500]` with 501 queries.
- `secret06`: 25k piles of 1 coin with 25k queries asking for coin 25,001.

Random tests
============
- `secret07` onward are pseudo-random within the size and byte limits.
